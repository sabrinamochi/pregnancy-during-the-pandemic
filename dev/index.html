		                    Pregnancy is a time of great stress. You worry about everything from eating the right foods and getting the right vitamins to exercising enough, but also not too much.

		                    Being pregnant in the middle of a pandemic adds new and different stressors: isolation, loneliness and fear of the unknown - Will the hospital allow my partner to present during the childbirth and post birth? Will physically connecting with friends and family be dangerous? Is continuing with my pregnancy during a lockdown a feasible option?

		                    Juliet Murray had a panic attack in a vegetable aisle when a man stormed towards a bag of salads besides her. Although they were both wearing a mask, Murray nearly cried thinking of potentially getting exposed to the virus and not being able to protect the baby in her belly. “I was so terrified … just because I saw somebody blatantly disregarding social distancing,” said Murray.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>

		                    Murray discovered her unplanned pregnancy in March last year. It was the beginning of the virus outbreak, and like many others, Murray never expected it to shut down the entire country for more than one year.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    For the first two months of her pregnancy, she completely isolated herself at home, not seeing anyone, including her fiance, who worked as a liquor distributor. “It was just so unknown. The fear of … what I am bringing a baby into was really scary because I wanted to protect my baby from anything from day one,” said Murray. She did everything she could, from frequently washing her hands and strictly social distancing to always wearing a mask and avoiding going out.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    But still, she questioned whether that was enough to protect her baby. “I had to go to the hospital for appointments. I had to deliver traditionally in a hospital. it was unavoidable.”
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    Murray drove herself to her first in-person doctor appointment, checked in while standing six feet away from the desk, distanced from others waiting in the room by themselves. “We are all alone,” she thought. The doctors and nurses were in full protective gear but she only had a thin cloth mask. Everyday things that Murray had taken for granted her whole life , such as the buttons in the elevator or the arms of a chair in the waiting room, suddenly became anxiety provoking.
		                </p>

		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    She was allowed to FaceTime with her family during the ultrasound. She held the phone, laid back and heard the first heartbeat with her parents and fiance on the other end of the phone. “My mom started crying … I&#x27;m pretty sure my dad cried too, even though he was pretending he wasn&#x27;t crying,” said Murray.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    Before the first ultrasound, Murray sometimes wondered whether there was really a small person living in her body because she hadn’t felt much. “Hearing that first heartbeat and seeing the little blob on the ultrasound ... just made it real,” said Murray. She was ecstatic and wanted to be around everyone she loves. She wanted to shout out, “Hey! I am pregnant!”
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    But that never happened. She left the hospital and drove herself home. “That was all there was to do. I went home and quarantined,” said Murray.

		                    Around 60 percent of pregnant people are reporting feeling levels of stress and anxiety that interfere with their daily functioning, according to Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski, the lead researcher of an international study focused on how COVID-19 is affecting those pregnant and giving birth. “We&#x27;re seeing higher levels than we&#x27;ve seen in any of the other studies,” said Jelliffe-Pawlowski.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    The reasons vary. Some are concerned about getting infected, some fear being socially isolated and others are worried about the constantly changing hospital practices. According to Jelliffe-Pawlowski, more than 90 percent of the research participants indicate they stay connected to family and friends. “But having those people doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re not feeling depressed and lonely and scared,” said Jelliffe-Pawlowski.

		            </div>

		                <p>
		                    Rebecca Joachim, director of Crisis Services at Boston Center for Pregnancy Choices, agrees. “I definitely think that there&#x27;s been an increase in depression,” said Joachim. She has spent more time than usual counseling clients to ensure they received the support they needed. “It can be really isolating and difficult … Counseling would be a huge piece specifically for moms and especially looking at postpartum depression,” said Joachim.
