		                    Pregnancy is a time of great stress. You worry about everything from eating the right foods and getting the right vitamins to exercising enough, but not too much. Being pregnant in the middle of a pandemic adds new and different stressors: isolation, loneliness and fear of the unknown, financial and health security.
		                </p>

		                    Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Americans have faced some of the highest rates of unemployment since the Great Depression; many have lost a stable income and others have had to continue to work with reduced pay. And communities of color have been hardest hit by both the virus and the economic fallout.

		                    Juliet Murray had a panic attack in a vegetable aisle when a man stormed towards a bag of salad besides her. Although they were both wearing a mask, Murray nearly cried thinking of potentially getting exposed to the virus and not being able to protect the baby in her belly. “I was so terrified … just because I saw somebody blatantly disregarding social distancing,” said Murray.

		                    Murray discovered her unplanned pregnancy in March last year. It was the beginning of the virus outbreak, and like many others, Murray never expected the entire country to shut down for more than a year.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    For the first two months of her pregnancy, she completely isolated herself at home, not seeing anyone, including her fiance, who worked as a liquor distributor and was unable to work from home. “It was just so unknown. The fear of … what I am bringing a baby into was really scary because I wanted to protect my baby from anything from day one,” said Murray. She did everything she could, from frequently washing her hands and strictly social distancing to always wearing a mask and avoiding going out.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    But still, she questioned whether that was enough to protect her baby. “I had to go to the hospital for appointments. I had to deliver traditionally in a hospital. it was unavoidable.”

		                    Murray drove herself to her first in-person doctor appointment, checked in while standing six feet away from the desk, distanced from others waiting in the room by themselves. “We are all alone,” she thought. The doctors and nurses were in full protective gear but she only had a thin cloth mask. Everyday things that Murray had taken for granted her whole life , such as the buttons in the elevator or the arms of a chair in the waiting room, suddenly became anxiety provoking.
		                </p>

		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    She was allowed to FaceTime with her family during the ultrasound. She held the phone, laid back and heard the first heartbeat with her parents and fiance on the other end of the phone. “My mom started crying … I&#x27;m pretty sure my dad cried too, even though he was pretending he wasn&#x27;t crying,” said Murray.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    Before the first ultrasound, Murray sometimes wondered whether there was really a small person living in her body because she hadn’t felt much. “Hearing that first heartbeat and seeing the little blob on the ultrasound ... just made it real,” said Murray. She was ecstatic and wanted to be around everyone she loves. She wanted to shout out, “Hey! I am pregnant!”

		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    But that never happened. She left the hospital and drove herself home. “That was all there was to do. I went home and quarantined,” said Murray.

		                    Around 60 percent of pregnant people are reporting feeling levels of stress and anxiety that interfere with their daily functioning, according to Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski, the lead researcher for HOPE COVID-19, an international study focused on how COVID-19 is affecting those pregnant and giving birth. “We&#x27;re seeing higher levels than we&#x27;ve seen in any of the other studies,” said Jelliffe-Pawlowski.

		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    The reasons vary, according to Jelliffe-Pawlowski. Some are concerned about getting infected, some fear being socially isolated and others are worried about the constantly changing hospital practices. More than 90 percent of the research participants indicate they stay connected to family and friends. “But having those people doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re not feeling depressed and lonely and scared,” said Jelliffe-Pawlowski.

		                    Rebecca Joachim, director of Crisis Services at Boston Center for Pregnancy Choices, agrees. “I definitely think that there&#x27;s been an increase in depression,” said Joachim. She has spent more time than usual counseling clients to ensure they received the support they needed. “It can be really isolating and difficult … Counseling would be a huge piece specifically for moms and especially looking at postpartum depression,” said Joachim.

		                The drop in the number of children born this year follows a steady decline of the U.S. fertility rates that has been going on for decades. With a sharp decrease driven by the 2008 recession, the fertility rates hit a record low in 2019. Then came the pandemic, bringing many people face-to-face with an uncertain future and forcing them to make tough decisions about pregnancy.

		                Molly, 30, works in recruitment and asked that her last name not be used because her family isn&#x27;t aware of her circumstances. Her company cut her pay significantly in an attempt to prevent more layoffs after discharging one-third of the employees in late March last year.

		                Her husband lost a well-paid job after the restaurant where he worked closed. With the weight of the pandemic, worried over finances and losing the stable, job-guaranteed healthcare, he returned to drug use after 12 years of sobriety.

		                Molly immediately started questioning whether she should keep the baby when she discovered her pregnancy in December last year. They had wanted a second child so their school-aged daughter would have a sibling. Molly went off birth control at the end of February, right before the pandemic hit. “We thought [COVID-19] was going to be a short time,” said Molly. But it lasted longer than they had ever imagined.

She put all her belongings in a locker, put on a hospital gown and was given anesthesia. When she regained consciousness, she was in the recovery room.

		                From the beginning of the pandemic, Blacks and Latinos have faced unemployment rates significantly higher than whites. In the first quarter of 2020, Blacks had an unemployment rate of 6.3%, while Latino workers were at 4.8% and whites at 3.1%. Black and Latina women have seen jobs come back at a slower rate than white women.

		                “These inequities are really profound in Black and Latino people in terms of COVID exposure and pre-term birth. So it&#x27;s really just one thing on top of another thing for these women,” said Dr. Jelliffe-Pawlowski. “We&#x27;ve had several women say they had to choose between keeping their baby safe and having a job, or saying they had to decide between having enough food for their family or exposing their fetus to infection.”

		                Black and Latina women were more likely than white women to delay pregnancy and were also more concerned about accessing sexual and reproductive health services, according to the Guttmacher Institute study.

		                    Dashanna Hanlon, a 32-year-old doula and founder of Caring for Mamas serving mostly people of color, has seen an increase in clients asking for a payment plan or discounts. She joined virtual meetings with other doulas to propose offering free support. “We say who can take someone in July? This person really needs someone for free. It&#x27;s that kind of thing,” said Hanlon.

		                    The uncertainties of the laboring process itself are frightening enough, with the highly transmissive virus in place, more questions and concerns emerged. And for many Black pregnant women in this country, one extra burden is the intimidating statistics indicating the higher risks for Black women during childbirth. In fact, Black women are 50% more likely to have a premature baby than white women.

		                    In the face of those statistics, many Black women feel like they need an advocate by their side. “People feel like they don&#x27;t have a choice, especially with COVID and with their masks, they really aren&#x27;t able to speak up,” said Hanlon.

		                With no extra budget to hire a doula, Olive Deavers, 31, whose due date is April 29, can only count on her vocal and opinionated husband.

		                Working for a public health organization as a nutritionist, her daily works involve inspecting and improving state materials in nutrition education, breastfeeding and maternal childhood health.

		                Deavers wondered, perhaps, with her Master’s degree, stable finances and good healthcare, there’s a higher likelihood that she could prevent the worst case scenario.

		                She looked up the maternity death rates in multiple hospitals but the data wasn’t available. During her first therapist meeting after getting pregnant, Deavers talked about those numbers and concerns, “I was like, I really can&#x27;t do anything about this, you know?” Instead of a major hospital, Deavers and her husband chose a regional hospital with less patients and more personalized care. They familiarized with half of the physicians in the maternity team.

		                She also has a comprehensive birth plan that includes detailed “objectives” to remind and help her husband advocate for her in the ways she wanted. “My objective is something along the lines of don&#x27;t let me die, pretty much like do everything that&#x27;s medically necessary to save me and the child,” said Deavers.

		                    Things are getting better after we have learned and adapted to the new kind of “normalcy.” Hospital policies have matured. Front-line workers have been vaccinated. We got ourselves familiar with sewing masks and video chatting.

		                    But some familiar problems remain: sharp inequalities in maternity deaths, unemployment rates, housing and care for expectant mothers. These existed long before the pandemic but were exacerbated by it. Murray traces her anxiety to the health system’s lack of support for pregnant women, Molly’s decision to seek an abortion was directly tied to economic fears, and confusing information about the vaccines’ safety is at the root of many of Deavers concerns.
