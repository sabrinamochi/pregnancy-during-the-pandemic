		                    Juliet Murray had a panic attack in a vegetable aisle when a man stormed towards a bag of salad besides her. Although they were both wearing a mask, Murray nearly cried thinking of potentially getting exposed to the virus and not being able to protect the baby in her belly. “I was so terrified … just because I saw somebody blatantly disregarding social distancing,” said Murray.

		                    Murray discovered her unplanned pregnancy in March last year. It was the beginning of the virus outbreak, and like many others, Murray never expected the entire country to shut down for more than a year.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    For the first two months of her pregnancy, she completely isolated herself at home, not seeing anyone, including her fiance, who worked as a liquor distributor and was unable to work from home. “It was just so unknown. The fear of … what I am bringing a baby into was really scary because I wanted to protect my baby from anything from day one,” said Murray. She did everything she could, from frequently washing her hands and strictly social distancing to always wearing a mask and avoiding going out.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    But still, she questioned whether that was enough to protect her baby. “I had to go to the hospital for appointments. I had to deliver traditionally in a hospital. it was unavoidable.”

		                    Murray drove herself to her first in-person doctor appointment, checked in while standing six feet away from the desk, distanced from others waiting in the room by themselves. “We are all alone,” she thought. The doctors and nurses were in full protective gear but she only had a thin cloth mask. Everyday things that Murray had taken for granted her whole life , such as the buttons in the elevator or the arms of a chair in the waiting room, suddenly became anxiety provoking.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    She was allowed to FaceTime with her family during the ultrasound. She held the phone, laid back and heard the first heartbeat with her parents and fiance on the other end of the phone. “My mom started crying … I&#x27;m pretty sure my dad cried too, even though he was pretending he wasn&#x27;t crying,” said Murray.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    Before the first ultrasound, Murray sometimes wondered whether there was really a small person living in her body because she hadn’t felt much. “Hearing that first heartbeat and seeing the little blob on the ultrasound ... just made it real,” said Murray. She was ecstatic and wanted to be around everyone she loves. She wanted to shout out, “Hey! I am pregnant!”
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    But that never happened. She left the hospital and drove herself home. “That was all there was to do. I went home and quarantined,” said Murray.

		                        The majority of pregnant people are reporting feeling levels of stress and anxiety that interfere with their daily functioning, according to Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski, the lead researcher for HOPE COVID-19, an international study focused on how COVID-19 is affecting those pregnant and giving birth. “We&#x27;re seeing higher levels than we&#x27;ve seen in any of the other studies,” said Jelliffe-Pawlowski.

		                </div>
		                <div>
		                    <p>
		                        The reasons vary, according to Jelliffe-Pawlowski. Some are concerned about getting infected, some fear being socially isolated and others are worried about the constantly changing hospital practices. More than 90 percent of the research participants indicate they stay connected to family and friends. “But having those people doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re not feeling depressed and lonely and scared,” said Jelliffe-Pawlowski.

		                        Rebecca Joachim, director of Crisis Services at Boston Center for Pregnancy Choices, agrees. “I definitely think that there&#x27;s been an increase in depression,” said Joachim. She has spent more time than usual counseling clients to ensure they received the support they needed. “It can be really isolating and difficult … Counseling would be a huge piece specifically for moms and especially looking at postpartum depression,” said Joachim.

		                    Quintett Bowers, 29, a behavior technician in Virginia, is having her fourth baby due in the second week of May, 2021.

		                    Her work requires her to constantly visit the clients in person. Coming home after a long day of work, she resisted her temptation to hug her two beloved kids, stripped off her clothes and showered immediately.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>

		                    Taking care of three school-aged kids while being pregnant during a pandemic wasn’t easy. “[The kids] touch everything. The second you turn your back, they have their hands in their mouth. I&#x27;m like ... we&#x27;re definitely getting COVID tonight.”
		                </p>

		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    She once thought she had COVID while she was actually having a common cold. But after recalling all the life-threatening news stories, such as a mom gave birth but the baby died because of COVID complications or the baby survived but the mom didn’t, she talked herself into believing that she had COVID.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    “When people get sick, they don&#x27;t think about the flu anymore. They don&#x27;t think about allergies. They go straight to COVID. It must be COVID,” said Bowers. “I&#x27;m pregnant. I&#x27;m scared. I don&#x27;t know what to do. If I get COVID, is my baby going to die?”
		                </p>

		            <div>

		                    She texted everyone to say she loves them and called her mom to take care of her three kids before she went tested. The period waiting for the result was the longest wait of her life. She couldn’t help but kept calling the clinic to ask, “Hey, do you have my results? I need to know. I can&#x27;t take it.”
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    She thought about all the times she didn’t wash or sanitize her hands, the instances she touched her face and all the little details she didn’t pay attention to. Did she get the virus when she touched the gas pump? Did she forget to sanitize her hands right before she put the fries into her mouth? Did she touch her face after touching her keys or phone? Or perhaps one of her kids was in contact with someone who had the virus and brought it home.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    “How did I get the virus? Will I die? What about my baby?” she kept asking herself.
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>

		                    Two weeks before Jordan Capek’s due date, COVID-19 confirmed cases skyrocketed in the U.S. “it was really scary,” said Capek. She couldn’t stop asking herself all these questions that had had no easy answers in the beginning of a global pandemic - Would the hospital be safe and take precautions? Could she go grocery shopping and visit family members as usual?
		                </p>

		                    Capek found out she was pregnant during a Cuba trip in July, 2019. She missed her period, took a birth control test and then discovered the unplanned surprise, a baby. Capek and her partner were ecstatic. “I want to carry the pregnancy through term,” she thought.

		                    In March, some hospitals started modifying the visitor policy, allowing only one birthing partner or even none to participate in the laboring process. “I was really worried that my partner wasn&#x27;t going to be able to come in and be in the delivery room with me,” said Capek. “I was giving birth in two weeks ... and [the birth plan] needed to completely shift.”
		                </p>
		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    Capek agreed to induce baby Celia early, out of fear that she would end up in the delivery room completely alone if COVID protocols changed further. She was pushing for three hours and having a wild contraction that consumed all her energy. “At that point, I was like, do what you think. I can&#x27;t talk. I can only nod yes or no. It&#x27;s hard to make decisions like that.” said Capek.

		                    “Looking back on that, I would do it differently. Probably a home birth. Honestly, looking back on that, there’re just so many ways the hospital system didn&#x27;t allow pregnant people to be in touch with their bodies,” said Capek.

		                    The uncertainties of the laboring process itself are frightening enough, not to mention delivering a baby alone. “People feel like they don&#x27;t have a choice, especially with COVID and with their masks, they really aren&#x27;t able to speak up,” said Dashanna Hanlon, a 32-year-old doula and founder of Caring for Mamas

		                    Last September, one of Hanlon’s clients had a difficult childbirth due to unexpected separation. With no available room for her by the time they arrived, she waited alone for hours during her active phase of labor.

		            </div>
		            <div>

		                    “I can&#x27;t tolerate this anymore,“ the client told Hanlon when they finally were together. Her baby didn&#x27;t tolerate the pushing well and it ended up with a C-section.

		            </div>
		            <div>
		                <p>
		                    Hanlon couldn’t stop herself from thinking the if-else - If the client had kept laboring with her and had the support she expected, maybe her pain could have been reduced and the C-section could have been avoided. “That separation, I think, really just dampened the spirits,” said Hanlon.

		                    Olive Deavers, 31, who is due at the end of April, went to most of her doctor’s appointments alone. Deavers and her husband took virtual classes together. He accompanied her to the hospital although he could only wait in the parking lot. He always told her, “I am here with you. I want to know everything.”

		                    The first ultrasound was 12 weeks, although Deavers’ husband heard the first heartbeat through the phone, he wanted to know more. Deavers tried her best to offer detailed information to him, “[The heart beat] was more like that techno song ... under 40 feet per minute, a really good heart rate for a baby.”

		                    One time the appointment took Deavers longer than usual as there were too many patients. Not knowing what happened in the hospital, her husband felt extremely anxious and worried about the baby’s health condition. “If he was with me, he would have known that. The lack of contact gave him a little bit of anxiety, a little left out.”

		                    The drop in the number of children born this year follows a steady decline of the U.S. fertility rates that has been going on for decades. With a sharp decrease driven by the 2008 recession, the fertility rates hit a record low in 2019. Then came the pandemic, bringing many people face-to-face with an uncertain future and forcing them to make tough decisions about pregnancy.

		                    Molly immediately started questioning whether she should keep the baby when she discovered her pregnancy in December last year. They had wanted a second child so their school-aged daughter would have a sibling. Molly went off birth control at the end of February, right before the pandemic hit. “We thought [COVID-19] was going to be a short time,” said Molly. But it lasted longer than they had ever imagined.

		                    From the beginning of the pandemic, Blacks and Latinos have faced unemployment rates significantly higher than whites. In the first quarter of 2020, Blacks had an unemployment rate of 6.3%, while Latino workers were at 4.8% and whites at 3.1%. Black and Latina women have seen jobs come back at a slower rate than white women.
